# Invoice Number Uniqueness Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a robust invoice number uniqueness check system that prevents duplicate invoice numbers in the database. The system automatically generates unique invoice numbers and handles conflicts by incrementing the sequence until a unique number is found.

## Key Features

### 1. Duplicate Detection
- **Database Check**: Before saving any invoice, the system queries the database to check if the generated invoice number already exists
- **Exact Match Validation**: Uses precise string matching to ensure invoice numbers are truly unique
- **Real-time Verification**: Checks are performed at the moment of invoice creation, not just based on cached sequences

### 2. Automatic Conflict Resolution
- **Retry Mechanism**: If a duplicate is found, the system automatically generates a new invoice number
- **Sequence Increment**: Uses the existing `generateInvoiceNumber()` method which properly increments the database sequence
- **Maximum Attempts**: Limited to 10 attempts to prevent infinite loops in edge cases

### 3. User Feedback
- **Success Notification**: Shows the final invoice number in the success message
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages if unique number generation fails
- **Real-time Updates**: Updates the displayed invoice number in the UI with the final generated number

## Technical Implementation

### Modified Function: `handleSaveInvoice`

```typescript
const handleSaveInvoice = async () => {
  // ... validation logic ...
  
  if (invoiceModalMode === 'add' || activeTab === 'create-invoice') {
    // Start with the previewed invoice number to maintain consistency with UI
    let finalInvoiceNumber = generatedInvoiceNumber;
    let attempts = 0;
    const maxAttempts = 10;
    
    // Retry loop for unique number validation
    while (attempts < maxAttempts) {
      try {
        // Check for existing invoice with this number first
        const existingInvoices = await invoiceService.getInvoices({ search: finalInvoiceNumber }, 1, 1);
        const exactMatch = existingInvoices.data.find(invoice => 
          invoice.invoice_number === finalInvoiceNumber
        );
        
        if (!exactMatch) {
          // Unique number found, break the loop
          break;
        } else {
          // Duplicate found, generate new number and try again
          attempts++;
          if (attempts >= maxAttempts) {
            throw new Error(`Unable to generate unique invoice number after ${maxAttempts} attempts`);
          }
          // Only generate new number if conflict found
          finalInvoiceNumber = await invoiceService.generateInvoiceNumber();
        }
      } catch (numberError) {
        // Handle generation/validation errors
        attempts++;
        if (attempts >= maxAttempts - 1) {
          throw numberError;
        }
        // Generate new number for retry
        finalInvoiceNumber = await invoiceService.generateInvoiceNumber();
      }
    }
    
    // Include the final invoice number in the invoice data
    const invoiceDataWithNumber = {
      ...invoiceFormData,
      invoice_number: finalInvoiceNumber
    };
    
    // Save invoice with verified unique number
    await invoiceService.createInvoice(invoiceDataWithNumber);
    showSuccess(`Invoice ${finalInvoiceNumber} created successfully!`);
  }
};
```

## Algorithm Flow

1. **Start Invoice Creation**: User clicks "Save Invoice"
2. **Validation**: Perform standard form validation checks
3. **Number Validation Loop**:
   - Start with the previewed invoice number (shown in UI)
   - Query database with exact invoice number search
   - Check if any existing invoice has the same number
   - If unique: proceed to save
   - If duplicate: generate new number and retry
4. **Save Invoice**: Create invoice record with verified unique number and explicit invoice number
5. **User Feedback**: Display success message with final invoice number

## Key Improvements

### 1. UI Consistency
- **Preview Accuracy**: The invoice number shown in preview matches what gets saved
- **No Sequence Skipping**: Database sequence only increments when actually needed
- **Efficient Generation**: Avoids unnecessary sequence increments on every validation attempt

### 2. Optimized Algorithm
- **Start with Preview**: Uses the already-generated preview number as the first candidate
- **Conditional Generation**: Only generates new numbers when conflicts are detected
- **Explicit Number Passing**: Ensures the exact number is saved in the database

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Database Sequence Drift
- **Problem**: Manual database changes or concurrent access could cause sequence drift
- **Solution**: Real-time database checks ensure uniqueness regardless of sequence state

### 2. Concurrent Invoice Creation
- **Problem**: Multiple users creating invoices simultaneously could generate same numbers
- **Solution**: Each attempt generates a new number and checks database immediately

### 3. Financial Year Resets
- **Problem**: Financial year resets might not account for existing invoices
- **Solution**: Database check covers all existing invoices regardless of financial year

### 4. Infinite Loop Prevention
- **Problem**: System issues could cause endless retry attempts
- **Solution**: Maximum attempt limit (10) with clear error messaging

## Benefits

### 1. Data Integrity
- **Guaranteed Uniqueness**: No duplicate invoice numbers in the system
- **Audit Compliance**: Maintains proper invoice numbering for accounting purposes
- **Database Consistency**: Prevents primary key violations and data corruption

### 2. User Experience
- **Transparent Process**: Users see the final invoice number immediately
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic handling of conflicts without user intervention
- **Clear Feedback**: Success messages include the actual invoice number used

### 3. System Reliability
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handles database inconsistencies gracefully
- **Scalability**: Works with multiple concurrent users
- **Maintainability**: Clear logging for debugging and monitoring

## Logging and Monitoring

### Debug Information
- **Generation Attempts**: Logs each invoice number generation attempt
- **Duplicate Detection**: Logs when duplicates are found
- **Final Selection**: Logs the final unique invoice number selected
- **Error Conditions**: Detailed error logging for troubleshooting

### Console Output Examples
```
üî¢ Checking invoice number attempt 1: INV-2024-001
‚úÖ Invoice number is unique: INV-2024-001
üíæ Saving invoice with final number: INV-2024-001

-- OR in case of conflict --

üî¢ Checking invoice number attempt 1: INV-2024-001
‚ö†Ô∏è Invoice number already exists, generating new one: INV-2024-001
üî¢ Checking invoice number attempt 2: INV-2024-002
‚úÖ Invoice number is unique: INV-2024-002
üíæ Saving invoice with final number: INV-2024-002
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Performance Optimization
- Cache recent invoice numbers for faster duplicate checking
- Implement database-level unique constraints with automatic retry

### 2. Advanced Conflict Resolution
- Intelligent gap detection to reuse skipped numbers
- Configurable retry strategies for different scenarios

### 3. Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time tracking of duplicate detection frequency
- Alerts for unusual numbering patterns or high retry rates

## Configuration

- **Default**: 10 attempts
- **Rationale**: Balances thoroughness with performance
- **Customization**: Can be adjusted based on system requirements

### Search Strategy
- **Method**: Exact string matching using database search
